# About me

- 🏎 I’m currently studying Mechanical Engineering at University College London and I am in my 3rd year. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal dissertation, which will revolve around developing a machine learning code to process images or videos in Python. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with making my machine learning code more efficient. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a Build Lead Engineer for UCL Formula Student team and this year I am directly responsible for building our racecar in time for the competition in July 2026.
